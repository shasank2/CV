				education from St.Xaviers Jawalakhel and studied A levels at 
				Islington college. Currently I am continuing to do my Bachelors 
				degree in Computing at Islington college.<br>
				<br><br>
                
                Taking about my personality I am very calm and quiet mostly. I have 
                my feeling reserved and only express it to few chosen people. Anyways 
				I do like to show my sarcastic and funny side to people. Not only that,
				but I am helping, kind and motivating to people in need.<br>
				<br>
				
				In my future i would like to develop solutions of problems in various 
				fields like medical, business, technology, etc.using computers. Besides,
				I am intrested in travlling to new places and doing photography as a 
				side hobby. Lastly I never leave apart movies, animes, games and their 
				discussions.<br>
