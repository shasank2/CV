	     Technology is any method or thing that people have been using since a long time to 
		 ease the humanity. It has been growing rapidly in various ways by people as they are
		 trying to find solution of every possible problem. Technology can be anything, Whether
		 software, a device, a certain way, etc. Anyways we are too much into technology and now
		 we are starting to slowly realize what are its drawbacks.<br>
		 <br><br>
		 For me I mostly am on my laptop and my phone. These two are the major things I see as 
         technology. Both of these are used as entertainment purpose. I play online games like 
         Dota in laptop and PUBG in phone. Both games I can stay home and play online even when 
         my friends are not physically available. There is internal voice chat system where I can 
 		 discuss game things to friends while we play. It just needs internet connection on my laptop 
         or phone play the game. Talking about the internet, it is a kind of technology too. It is a 
         service provided by people to be connected to the global network called World Wide Web. 
         On the internet people can look at different ideas, opinion, resources, etc. being shared 
         by other people. Or even oneself can share his/her own things. It gives access to social
         media too. Social media can be considered as technology as well. In social media people 
		 can be sharing various news and status of people. Besides these I have been using various    
		 other kind oftechnologies for domastic purpose like washing machine can be used to wash 
		 clothes. Heater can be used to heat ourselves when cold. Similarly air conditiner can be 
		 used to generate cold air when hot.<br>
